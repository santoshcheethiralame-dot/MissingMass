# Experiment registry

One row per experiment. Pages are in [`experiments/`](experiments/). The
study hypotheses (PH, SH) are in
[`../docs/PREREGISTRATION.md`](../docs/PREREGISTRATION.md). Gates and dates are
in [`../docs/ROADMAP.md`](../docs/ROADMAP.md).

IDs E01–E14 match the experiment menu in `research/README.md` §4. E00 and
E15–E17 were added when the notebook was built.

**Tiers:** *core* experiments are needed for the NeurIPS 2027 paper;
*important* ones strengthen it; *stretch* ones are follow-ups or separate
papers.

## Unregistered backlog (exploratory ideas)

None of these is registered. Each needs its own page before running.

- Saturation of LLM idea generation as a free accumulation dataset (Si et
  al. 2024).
- Identity-threshold sensitivity on WildTeaming tactic clusters.
- Attacker-level histories in Tensor Trust.
- MMLU-Redux with 10 to 30 cheap detectors: does more K rescue Kansal's
  negative result?
- Static analysers vs fuzzers on Magma (112 known bugs).
- BAITBENCH (`juanjvazquez/BAITBENCH`, MIT): 1,258 runs as derived evidence
  packets, but only 3 shortcut families. Usable as a cheap check of judging
  and dependence across 7 models; not a richness testbed.
